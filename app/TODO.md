# TODO

1. Implement the login and signup functionality for the app. When a user logs in or signs up, you
   can check the database for their username and password, and insert a new row into the users table
   if the user is signing up.


2. Implement the wheel of fortune game. When a user starts a game, you can insert a new row into the
   game_history table to store the score.

    1. Create a layout for the game screen, including a wheel and a score display.
    2. Create a class to represent the game state. This could include variables for the current
       score, the current round, and any other relevant game data.
    3. Write code to handle user input. This could include spinning the wheel and guessing letters
       or solving the puzzle.
    4. Update the game state based on user input. For example, if the user spins the wheel and lands
       on a certain space, you might need to update the score or move to the next round.
    5. Insert a new row into the game_history table when the game is over.

3. Display the game history to the user. You can do this by querying the game_history table and
   displaying the results to the user.

To create a Wheel of Fortune game in Java, you will need to do the following:

    Design the game's user interface. This could be a simple text-based interface, or a more advanced graphical interface using a library like JavaFX.

    Implement the game's logic. This will involve creating a class or classes to represent the game state, including the puzzle, the available letters, and the players. You will also need to implement the rules for spinning the wheel, guessing letters, and solving the puzzle.

    Integrate with a database. To store information about the game and the players, you will need to use a database. SQLite is a good choice for a Java application, as it is lightweight and easy to integrate. You will need to create tables to store information such as the puzzles, players, and game history, and write code to execute SQL queries to read and write data to the database.

Here are some additional tips to consider when implementing your Wheel of Fortune game:

    Use object-oriented programming principles to organize your code and make it easy to understand and maintain.

    Test your code thoroughly to ensure that it is correct and stable.

    Consider adding features like multiple rounds, scoring, and power-ups to make the game more interesting and engaging for the player.
